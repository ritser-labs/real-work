Write the Flask application code to a file named `app/__init__.py` (not app.py).\n2. Ensure the Flask app instance is named `app` and is importable as `from app import app`.\n3. Handle division by zero by returning a 400 status code with an error message.\n4. Run the Flask application as a background task using the `background` flag.",
